see if its really necessary creating the downoad dir, I dont think so cause when the pdfs are moved, it has its address, and if there isnt any, they will create on their own


I need to see the other pages for download

after every error log, reset




Sum all error logs


CODE THAT DELETS ONE PAGED PDFS:
import PyPDF2
import os

def count_pdf_pages(file_path):
                    try:
                        with open(file_path, 'rb') as pdf_file:
                            reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdf_file)
                            return len(reader.pages)
                    except Exception as e:
                        print(f"Error while counting pages in {file_path}: {e}")
                        return 0


base_dir = "C:\\Users\\nikao\\Documents\\Julgados"

for root, dirs, Classefiles in os.walk(base_dir):
    for Classefile in Classefiles:
        for moreFile in file:
            if file.endswith(".pdf"):
                path = os.path.join(root, file)
                print(f"Processing file: {path}")
                count_pdf_pages(path)
